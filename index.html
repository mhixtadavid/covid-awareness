            <h2>About Covid-19</h2>
            <p>COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus,is a viral respiratory disease
                that was first identified in Wuhan,China in December 2019.It can be contagious and spreads
                quickly. Over one million people have died from COVID-19 in the United States.
            <p>The coronavirus epidemic started in China. It quickly spread globally, altering how we view globalization and the digital age forever. While many
                 nations were on lockdown, international travel had been suspended, businesses and industries struggled to survive, and new opportunities and challenges
                  were emerging. One of the most intriguing effects of the pandemic was seen in higher education, where new cutting-edge technologies are sparking a
                   digital revolution. 

                The WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The coronavirus pandemic generated problems on a global scale and greatly
                 influenced daily life routines, connections, and household dynamics. However, depending on regional variations in the spread of infections and the
                  effectiveness of precautionary measures, as well as subjective and environmental hazards and protective factors, the impact varied significantly.

            <p>COVID-19 most often causes respitarory sysmtoms that can feel much cold,the flu, or pneumonia.
                COVID-19 may attack more than the lungs and respiratory system. Other parts of the body may also
                be affected by the disease.

            <h2>HOW DOES COVID-19 SPREAD?</h1>
            <p>COVID-19 spreads when an infected person breaths out droplets and very small particles that contain the virus
                Other people can breathe in these droplets and particles, or these droplets and 
                particles can land on their eye,nose or mouth. In some circumstances these droplets may contaminate surfaces they touch.
                 Anyone infected with COVID-19 can spread it, even if they do NOT have symptoms.
            </p>   
             <p> The risk of animals spreading the virus that causes COVID-19 to people is low. The virus can spread from people to animals during close contact.
                 People with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should avoid contact with animals.
